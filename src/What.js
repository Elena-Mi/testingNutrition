					There is growing evidence that nutritional therapy can play a role in
					treating autism spectrum disorder and other conditions such as ADHD,
					anxiety, and depression. According to the Centers of Disease Control,
					children on the autism disorder are three-and-a-half times more likely
					to experience gastrointestinal disorders than neurotypical children.
					In these cases, a doctor may recommend probiotic supplements. With the
					brain’s health driving the way we feel and behave, it makes sense to
					examine our diets to identify lacking nutrients or find supplements to
					ultimately improve the brain’s ability and how the body processes
					foods.
